# README

Personal Blog and site redesign.

I'm using this to remind myself of how rails works.

Features TODO:
- Flight Tracker - Private Pilot Training Progress / Where I've Flown using Foreflight's API
  - https://dispatch.foreflight.com/swagger/index.html
- Path Of Exile Crafting Service - Available crafts & Crafting Costs
  - look into api's or database lookups for bench costs?
